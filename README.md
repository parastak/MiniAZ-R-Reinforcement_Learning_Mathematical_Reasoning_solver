# 🧠 miniAZ-R: A Tiny Reinforced Math Solver Inspired by AZR (2025)

Inspired by the [AZ-R paper](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/absolute-zero-reinforced-self-play-reasoning)
“Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-Play Reasoning with Zero Data” (2025) by Andrew Zhao Yiran Wu, Tong Wu, Quentin Xu, and collaborators.

This repository is not affiliated with the original authors, but serves as a practical miniature replication and experimental foundation toward that vision.



🎯 Goal
--
Train an RL agent from scratch to deduce symbolic mathematical equations through trial and error, guided by curriculum learning and self-play without supervised labels
or solvers.  From initial failure and debugging to achieving mastery on a curriculum of increasingly difficult mathematical tasks.
